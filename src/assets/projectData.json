Building trust and ensuring transparency are crucial for the adoption of autonomous bike systems. In addition to these technological considerations, commuters are impacted by several shortcomings in the bicycle industry. Navigation systems often fail to align with how they plan routes based on familiarity, road safety, and traffic conditions. Cyclists frequently use their phones while riding for navigation and communication, causing distractions and posing significant safety risks. The clutter caused by mounting these devices to the handlebars can lead to suboptimal handling and reduce a rider’s ability to take swift actions in the event of an emergency. "

Riders can select route preferences in the accompanying phone app, tailoring their navigation to their priorities. The app also allows users to provide feedback, enhancing future routing accuracy. When connected to the bike, the display shows important phone notifications, which users can respond to via voice control. Our design prioritizes simplicity to minimize distractions, enabling riders to start their journey quickly and stay safe throughout their commute."

Initially I had a lot of trouble generating ideas that I felt had novel and tangible benefits. I really enjoyed this idea generation process, discussing with other students was extremely beneficially in helping me think about the problem more deeply. Once I converged on this idea, I began iterating on the user flow. This helped me answer a lot of questions I had about how this this feature would actually work. These flows helped me create a framework for the phone screens I would generate. One thing that I had not originally considered was the integration of the Apple Watch. Initially I restricted the process of confirming or cancelling a date to the phone app. A big improvement that this project underwent was pulling this functionality out of the app to help create a less disruptive experience."

My aim was to subtly incentivize users to commit to the dates they arranged. After much thought, I chose to describe cancelling as bailing. This term strikes a balance, subtly implying that cancelling is generally unfavorable without being overly dramatic. For instance, I had initially considered using termination to describe the act of cancelling, but this felt excessively harsh. To further encourage commitment, I implemented a celebratory feature in both the phone app and the watch for when a user confirms a date. This addition serves as a positive reinforcement, promoting follow-through on planned dates. These carefully considered language choices and features were all part of a strategy to foster a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm about keeping commitments made through the app.",

This notification prompts the user to confirm they are on their way. Initially, this functionality was confined to the phone app, but I later extended it to the watch to encourage prompt responses and reduce the steps needed to confirm attendance at a date.
