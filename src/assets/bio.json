My personal experiences have instilled in me a deep empathy for underrepresented groups, and this empathy drives my commitment to ensuring that every design solution I create is considerate of diverse audiences. I strive to develop user experiences that not only meet the functional needs of all users but also resonate on a deeper, more personal level. By leading with empathy and inclusivity, I aim to create designs that make a positive impact and foster a sense of belonging for everyone."
