This pursuit of creating has led me to develop skills in 3D modeling, rapid prototyping, PCB design, embedded systems, and software development. During my undergraduate education in engineering I worked on a wearable research project where I created a haptic feedback device aimed at improving healing outcomes for physical therapy patients. After completing my undergraduate degree I was employed as an electrical power engineer where I worked on the development of critical infrastructure in the data center space. Now at Carnegie Mellon, I'm focused on enhancing my design expertise and broadening my creative horizons."
